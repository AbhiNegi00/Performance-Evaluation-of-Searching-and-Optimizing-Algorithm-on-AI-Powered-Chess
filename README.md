# Performance-Evaluation-of-Searching-and-Optimizing-Algorithm-on-AI-Powered-Chess
This project involved developing an AI-powered chess application capable of playing against human opponents using advanced machine learning algorithms. The primary goal was to evaluate the performance of various searching and optimizing algorithms in a chess environment to determine their efficiency and effectiveness.
Key Algorithms Used:

Minimax Algorithm:

A decision-making algorithm used for minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. 🧠

It explores all possible moves in a game and selects the move that leads to the best possible outcome for the player while assuming the opponent is also playing optimally.

Alpha-Beta Pruning:

An optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm. 🔍✨

It reduces the number of nodes that are evaluated by the Minimax algorithm by eliminating branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.

This significantly improves the efficiency and speed of the decision-making process.

Negamax Algorithm:

A variant of the Minimax algorithm. 🔄

It simplifies the implementation by considering that the value of a position is the negative of the value from the opponent's perspective.

This approach makes the algorithm more elegant and easier to implement.

Technology Used:

Python: The programming language used for implementing the algorithms and developing the AI-powered chess application. 🐍💻
